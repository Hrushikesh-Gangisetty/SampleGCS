# Text-to-Speech Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented text-to-speech functionality for your Android Ground Control Station app. The app will now announce:
- **"Connected"** when the drone connects
- **"Disconnected"** when the drone disconnects  
- **"Calibration started"** when compass/magnetometer calibration begins
- **"Calibration completed successfully"** when calibration finishes successfully
- **"Calibration failed"** when calibration fails

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. **TextToSpeechManager.kt** (NEW)
- Location: `app/src/main/java/com/example/aerogcsclone/utils/TextToSpeechManager.kt`
- Purpose: Manages all text-to-speech functionality
- Features:
  - Initializes Android TTS engine
  - Provides methods for connection and calibration announcements
  - Handles TTS lifecycle (initialization, speaking, cleanup)
  - Uses English (US) language
  - Configurable speech rate and pitch

### 2. **AndroidManifest.xml** (MODIFIED)
- Added permission: `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`
- This permission is required for text-to-speech functionality

### 3. **SharedViewModel.kt** (MODIFIED)
- Added TTS manager instance
- Added TTS initialization method: `initializeTextToSpeech(context)`
- Added announcement methods:
  - `announceCalibrationStarted()`
  - `announceCalibrationFinished(isSuccess: Boolean)`
  - `announceCalibrationFinished()` (general version)
- Added connection status monitoring with automatic TTS announcements
- Added proper cleanup in `onCleared()`

### 4. **CompassCalibrationViewModel.kt** (MODIFIED)  
- Integrated TTS announcements into calibration flow:
  - Announces "Calibration started" when compass calibration begins
  - Announces "Calibration completed successfully" when calibration succeeds
  - Announces "Calibration failed" when calibration fails

### 5. **MainActivity.kt** (MODIFIED)
- Added SharedViewModel initialization with TTS setup
- TTS is initialized when the app starts

### 6. **AppNavGraph.kt** (MODIFIED)
- Updated navigation to properly pass SharedViewModel to all screens
- Ensures TTS functionality is available throughout the app

## How It Works

### Connection Announcements
When your app connects to or disconnects from the drone:
1. The `SharedViewModel` monitors the `isConnected` state
2. When the connection status changes, it automatically calls the TTS manager
3. You'll hear "Connected" or "Disconnected" through the device speakers

### Calibration Announcements
When you start compass calibration:
1. The `CompassCalibrationViewModel` calls `sharedViewModel.announceCalibrationStarted()`
2. You'll hear "Calibration started"
3. When calibration completes, you'll hear either:
   - "Calibration completed successfully" (on success)
   - "Calibration failed" (on failure)

## Testing the Implementation

### To Test Connection Announcements:
1. Launch your app
2. Go to the Connection screen
3. Connect to your drone (TCP or Bluetooth)
4. You should hear "Connected" when connection is established
5. Disconnect and you should hear "Disconnected"

### To Test Calibration Announcements:
1. Ensure your drone is connected
2. Navigate to Calibrations → Compass Calibration
3. Start the compass calibration process
4. You should hear "Calibration started" when it begins
5. Complete or cancel the calibration to hear the finish announcement

## Troubleshooting

### If TTS Doesn't Work:
1. **Check Device Volume**: Ensure media volume is turned up
2. **TTS Engine**: Some devices may need Google TTS engine installed from Play Store
3. **Permissions**: Verify RECORD_AUDIO permission is granted
4. **Device Compatibility**: Test on different Android versions if available

### Debug Logging:
The implementation includes extensive logging with tag "TextToSpeechManager":
- Check Android Studio Logcat for TTS initialization messages
- Look for "Speaking: [message]" logs when announcements should play
- Check for "TTS not ready" warnings if there are issues

## Customization Options

### Changing Voice Messages:
Edit the constants in `TextToSpeechManager.kt`:
```kotlin
const val MSG_CONNECTED = "Connected"
const val MSG_CALIBRATION_STARTED = "Calibration started"
// etc.
```

### Adjusting Speech Settings:
In `TextToSpeechManager.onInit()`, modify:
```kotlin
tts.setSpeechRate(1.0f)  // 1.0 = normal speed
tts.setPitch(1.0f)       // 1.0 = normal pitch
```

### Adding More Announcements:
1. Add new message constants to `TextToSpeechManager`
2. Add new announcement methods to `SharedViewModel`
3. Call the methods from appropriate ViewModels/UI components

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready to use! The text-to-speech functionality will:
- ✅ Announce "Connected" when drone connects
- ✅ Announce "Disconnected" when drone disconnects  
- ✅ Announce "Calibration started" when compass calibration begins
- ✅ Announce "Calibration completed successfully" or "Calibration failed" when done

You can now build and test your app to hear the voice announcements during connection and calibration operations.
